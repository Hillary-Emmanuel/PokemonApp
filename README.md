Welcome to My Pokemon App

# Task

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional and visually appealing Pokémon information application using React and the PokeAPI. The challenge is to dynamically fetch, display, and lazily load Pokémon data, including their name, types, abilities, stats, and official artwork. Users should be able to browse or search for Pokémon and view detailed pages with rich information formatted in a responsive layout.

# Description

To solve the problem, we built a React-based frontend that interacts with the PokeAPI to retrieve real-time data on different Pokémon. The app uses modern web development techniques, including:

React Router for navigating between the Pokémon list and detailed views.

Axios for API calls to the PokeAPI.

React Intersection Observer for lazy loading images and information sections.

Responsive CSS styling using custom styles to provide a polished user experience.

Component-based structure to ensure clean, reusable code.

Lazy loading techniques to improve performance and user experience.

Each Pokémon has a dedicated detail page that shows:

Official artwork.

ID, name, and types with color-coded badges.

List of abilities.

Base stats with visual stat bars.
